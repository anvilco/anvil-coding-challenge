# Anvil Coding Takehome
Hello ðŸ‘‹ & welcome to the anvil coding challenge. We appreciate you taking the time to complete the assignment and we're excited about the prospect of you joining the team!

The goal of this assignment is to get a sense for how you think and solve problems, not for us to test magic keyword knowledge of our tech stack. If you're having build issues ðŸ”§ with the project, please don't hesitate to contact us.

## How it works

* You will get an email from one of us with the specific task to complete
* Fork this repo into your own account
* Make a new branch
* When you are finished, make a PR on your fork, and invite the person specified in the email to your fork
* We will take a look at your solution, then talk through your solution during your interview

## Getting the project running

```bash
# Fork this project, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/...

cd anvil-coding-challenge

# Install dependencies
yarn

# Start development server
yarn dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000

# Run the linter, server tests, and client tests
yarn test
```

Other helpful things

```bash
yarn lint # Only the linter
yarn test:server # Only the server tests
yarn test:client # Only the client tests

yarn db:reset # Reset the DB to the initial seed data
```

## What even is it?

It's a single page app that shows a list of files.

You can add new files!

That's all it does without your help!


#### Notes
I configured the application to only display files uploaded by the user
If there was functionality on the front end to look at files for a different user, that is possible
Some of changes I would make if this was truly for production:
1) Use pagination to display the files, have buttons for next, back and clicking on the individual pages
2) Allow user to sort by title and date uploaded (asc or desc)
    - add updated_at and created_at columns to "files" table to facilitate
3) Have table for user and add `user_id` colmumn in "files" table
4) Implement authentication middleware and not get username from os
